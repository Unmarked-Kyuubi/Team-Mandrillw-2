            We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such

            We do not intentionally collect information that is stored in your

            Excel Comp employees do not access private diffs unless required to

          <p class="space-paragraph">
            If your diff is public, anyone (including us) may view its contents.

            diff, such as email addresses, that information may be indexed by
            search engines or used by third parties. In addition, while we do
