                    You must be a human to create an account. Accounts
                    registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not

                    A machine account is an account set up by an individual
                    human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account,
                    provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its
                    actions. A machine account is used exclusively for
                    performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the
                    actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account
                    is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may
                    maintain no more than one free machine account in addition
                    to your free personal account.

                    One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one
                    free account (if you choose to control a machine account as
                    well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a
                    machine).

                  <li>
                    You must be age 13 or older. Excel Comp does not target our
                    Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users
                    under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the
                    age of 13, we will terminate that User's account
                    immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the
                    United States, your country's minimum age may be older; in
                    such a case, you are responsible for complying with your
