    <ol class="brief-list">
      Before proceeding any further to compare your excel files there are some important things you need to take note of.
     <li>Due to it's limitations excel comp can only compare the first sheet of your excel file</li> 
      <li>Excel comp compares your two excel files and outputs the resuls row by row. i.e It prints the difference between a row first before moving on to a column.</li>

      <li>Excel comp tries to compare the cells using the names of the cells. It gives each cell a name corresponding to "Cell (Row Number), (Column Number}" You are also able to name the cells yourself. The steps to give a cell a name are given below using the Name Manager tool in Excel. This tool allows you to create and manage named ranges in your Excel workbook.

<ol class="brief-nested-list">

 <li>Open the Excel workbook that you want to work with.</li>
      
      <li>Click the Formulas tab in the ribbon at the top of the window.</li>
      
      <li>In the Defined Names section of the ribbon, click the Name Manager button.</li>
      
      <li>In the Name Manager dialog box, click the New button.</li>
      
      <li>In the New Name dialog box, enter a name for the cell in the Name field.</li>
      
      <li>In the Refers to field, enter the cell reference of the cell you want to give a name to. For example, if you want to give a name to cell A1, you would enter A1 in the Refers to field.</li>
      
      <li>Click the OK button to save the new name.</li>
      
      <li>In the Name Manager dialog box, click the Close button to close the dialog box.</li>
      
      Using the name manager tool allows the user to give the cells names that can be accessed by javascript. Note this is not compulsory and can be ignored if you feel you could understand the differences but for the best experience use the name manager. Thank you for your time.
